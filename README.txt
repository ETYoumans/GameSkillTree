Game Skill Tree

Turn your game backlog into an interactive skill tree!
Track your progress, unlock games, and make completing your backlog more fun.

How to get started:

1. Create a Tree File

Use a .txt file (Notepad works fine).

The first line is the tree title.

Each subsequent line is a game title.

Add subtitles in parentheses for optional goals (e.g., randomizer mode, true ending).
Subtitles will not affect images.
