Game Skill Tree:

To Do List:

1. Add Game images to renderer (maybe not, if not, design nodes better)
2. Create game box in sidebar. I want to click the game on the tree. It will show up in the gamebox container. 
It will have an image and a button. The button will say unlock if it is locked, or beaten if it is unlocked.
3. Add point counter and spender, checks for points before unlocks.
4. Use a game db API to get game images. 
5. Fix form to add platform to each game.
6. Add panning and zoom to tree container.
7. Fixed UI and CSS
